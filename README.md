Hi there üëã I'm Bhuvan!
Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer | Machine Intelligence & Data Science Specialist
I'm a passionate software engineering student specializing in Machine Intelligence and Data Science (MIDS) from PES University, expected to graduate in 2026.[1] My journey is driven by a deep interest in developing intelligent systems that solve real-world problems, with a particular focus on Reinforcement Learning for optimization and Natural Language Processing for human-computer interaction.

I am committed to continuous learning and dedicated to gaining hands-on experience across various tech domains to contribute to innovative industry projects.[1] I thrive in collaborative environments and am always eager to expand my expertise in areas like deep learning model optimization and responsible AI deployment.

üõ†Ô∏è My Technical Toolkit
Here's a snapshot of the technologies I work with:

Languages: Python, Java (+OOPS, DSA), HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL [1]

ML/AI Frameworks & Libraries: TensorFlow, Scikit-learn, Hugging Face, Pandas, NumPy, OpenCV, Gymnasium, Stable Baselines3, T5, StarCoder [1]

Tools & Databases: Git, GitHub, Linux, MongoDB, MySQL, Streamlit, Pygame [1]

üöÄ Featured Machine Learning Projects
These are some of my key projects showcasing my skills in Machine Learning and AI. Make sure to check out their individual repositories for detailed READMEs!

Sudoku Solver from Image: This project is focused on Computer Vision and Deep Learning, utilizing Python, OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras. Its core impact is the development of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for digit recognition and a Streamlit UI for real-time puzzle solving.

Reinforcement Learning-based Inventory Management: This project delves into Reinforcement Learning and AI, built with Python, Gymnasium, and Stable Baselines3. It demonstrates dynamic restocking and discount strategies via RL within a supply chain simulator.

Code Comment and Visualization Generator: An Natural Language Processing and AI project, this system uses Python, T5, StarCoder, and Pygame. It leverages T5 for natural language descriptions and fine-tuned StarCoder for enhanced code-to-visual mapping.

Crop Rotation Model: This Reinforcement Learning and AI project, developed in Python, involved building a custom OpenAI Gym environment. It features a Q-learning agent trained for optimized planting schedules in sustainable agriculture planning.

üå± What I'm Looking For
I am actively seeking entry-level Machine Learning Engineer roles, AI/ML Internships, and Junior Data Scientist positions where I can apply my academic knowledge and project experience to real-world challenges. I'm eager to contribute to innovative teams and continue growing my expertise in the dynamic field of AI.[1]
